<b> Past Teaching Experience </b><br><br>
<b> <i>Heidelberg University </i></b> <br><br>

Summer Semester 2023 (April-July 2023): I taught an undergraduate seminar titled <a href="https://mitul-islam.github.io/class/matrix_groups_2023/matrix_groups_2023.html"> Matrix (Lie) Groups</a>. The course was meant for mid-level as well as advanced undergraduates.<br><br>

<b><i> University of Michigan </i></b><br><br>

I have taught the following undergraduate courses <i>as the primary instructor</i>. All the courses were taught in the innovative Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) style.

<b> Outreach Activities </b>: Webinar organized by the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata (India) on December 21, 2021

<br><br>Acted as a resource person and delivered a talk titled <i>"Hyperbolic Geometry and Beyond: An Algebraic and Dynamical Perspective"</i>. The talk was a gentle introduction to hyperbolic and projective geometry and the interplay of dynamical systems and differential geometry.

<br> <br> Goal: The webinar was <u>targeted towards young students</u> and the goal was to give them a <u>glimpse into the world of mathematics research</u>. 





<p>
<b> Mentoring: </b> In Winter 2020, I worked as a graduate student mentor in the Laboratory of Geometry at the University of Michigan, or <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/logm/">LOG(M)</a>.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Project: <em>Entropy degeneration of ideal projective pants</em> </li>
<li>Faculty advisors:<a href="http://www.harrisonbray.com/">Harrison Bray</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/giuseppemartone/home">Giuseppe Martone</a></li>
<li> Graduate student mentor: Mitul Islam </li>
<li>Undergraduate researchers: Marianne DeBrito, Andrew Nguyen, Marisa O'Gara </li>
<li> Goal: Computation of entropy of a family of ideal projective triangle groups and generating numerical evidence for a conjecture about entropy degeneration to its lower bound 0.5. This is an extension of a result of Xin Nie for projective closed surfaces.</li>
<li> Results: See [<a href=""https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/logm/wi20/entropy-project-outputs">gitlab</a>] for the computational results. <br />
The participating students are in the process of writing up their findings with the goal of a publication in an undergraduate math journal.
